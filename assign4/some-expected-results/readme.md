# some expected results

Here are a few of the buildings used in the tool we're using to test your applications. For each building, there is also the expected `scoring-results.txt` file so you can check your work.

None of these files should cause your application to explode - if you don't have wood or stone scoring implemented, you can put a 0 in for those scores, or even a blank. Just don't go boom!

Just to be clear: to get a C, your `scoring-results.txt` contents do NOT have to match the report - just the SCORES for glass and recycled have to match. **Make sure you have the word `glass` and `recycled` on the lines you report those scores, though!**
