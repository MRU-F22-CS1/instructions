# Debugging & Testing

## Introduction
This tutorial allows you to practice debugging code.

Imagine your company is developing a turn-based tank battle game (like the classic [scorched earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game)) game). Players take turns selecting a launch angle and velocity to launch a projectile at the other player, and the first to hit their opponent wins.

Unfortunately, your coworker has just won the lottery and quit, leaving you with some half-finished code. She has written a function to compute how far a projectile will travel given a launch angle and velocity, but the code hasn't been debugged yet.

Projectile kinematics says that for a projectile launched on a flat surface, the flight-time (time in the air, until the projectile lands) satisfies the quadratic equation:

> Â½ *g t*<sup>2</sup> + *v* sin(*a*) *t* = 0
>  
> where,  <br>
> *t* is the flight time in seconds <br>
> *a* is the angle of launch  <br>
> *v* is the velocity of launch in m/s  <br>
> *g* is acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> on earth) 

Given velocity *v* and angle *a*, this equation can be solved for *t* using the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula).

Given the flight time *t*, the horizontal distance travelled is given by:

> *x* = *v* cos(*a*) *t*
> 
> where,  <br>
> *x* is the horizontal distance travelled  <br>
> *v* is the velocity of launch in m/s  <br>
> *a* is the angle of launch  <br>
> *t* is the flight time in seconds

Your coworker has written the function below to compute horizontal distance travelled by a projectile. The intent of the function is to accept launch angle and velocity as parameters, use the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula) to compute *t*, and then use *t* to compute (and return) *x* using the equation above.

```python
from math import cos, sin, sqrt  # this line gives access to cos, sin, and sqrt (square-root) functions


g = 32.2 # gravitational acceleration = 32.2 ft/s/s


    def calculate_landing_point(angle: float, velocity: float) -> float:
    """
    compute the horizontal distance the projectile will travel
    :param angle: launch angle from horizontal, in radians
    :param velocity: velocity in meters / second
    :return: distance travelled in meters
    """

    # solve quadratic equation for t, the flight time
    a = -0.5 * g
    b = velocity * sin(angle)
    c = 0
    t = (-b - sqrt(b ** 2 - 4 * a * c)) / a * 2

    # calculate the horizontal distance travelled during time t
    x = velocity * cos(angle) * t

    return x
```


She has already done the math on paper, and identified 3 trajectories (shown below) that would cause the projectile to travel 500 m.

## Exercises
1. Paste the code above into your IDE. Read through the code & comments:
    - Does the code seem appropriate for the intent described above?
    - Do you see any mistakes in the code right away? Does the IDE highlight any errors that would prevent the code from running?

2. Use the three angle-velocity pairs in Figure 1 above as test inputs to the function (read the function comments carefully & ensure you pass in appropriate values). Is the output close to the expected 500 m? 

3. Manually trace the code in ```calculate_landing_point``` using one of the test inputs. Use a calculator to compute the expected results of each intermediate calulation.

4. Now that you've done the manual trace, find and correct the bug(s) in ```calculate_landing_point```. **Hint: there are 3 bugs to find in the code!**

5. What debugging techniques did you use to find the bugs?
    - visual inspection
    - letting the IDE highlight syntax errors
    - checking code against intended functionality
    - Manual tracing of the code
    - commenting out some lines of code to simplify the program
    - adding '''print''' statements to print out intermediate results for inspection
    - using breakpoints and IDE debugger to step through the code
    - calling a function with test inputs to check its functionality
    - Something not on this list?
